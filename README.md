Student Attendance Log Keeping Using Face Recognition is the application for students to keep the attendance records digitally and automatically. This system is developed to keep and generate attendance of students after realizing that the manual log keeping used in the current system is tedious job. The traditional system lacks accuracy due to human error as record keeping in paper sheets is time-consuming and not confidential. This proposed system will perform record keeping more accurately in less-time and effectively in comparison to the traditional method. 

<br>The human face is one of the unique and identical biological features with less chance of duplication which is used in this system of verification process for the individuals. Our proposed system will compare the student’s face against the image of faces stored in database and perform attendance if both input face data matches with the database. After that, attendance will be taken as well as records are stored into excel sheets. The purpose of this application is to recognize student’s face in the captured images. 
<br>This application can recognize face of students and perform their attendance in server database. The aim of this project is to design a digital platform for the teachers and students to maintain their attendance reports in digital format. This project combines an image processing suite installed using OpenCV and a database connected to backend server. We demonstrate the power and functionality of OpenCV framework by implementing in Python.
